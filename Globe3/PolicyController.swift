The information is then sent back to the server each time the application requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web application.\n\nWe use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the app. We will use the cookies to keep track of you whilst you navigate the app and to enable our app to recognise you when you visit.\n\nSession cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your application. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.\n\nWe use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this app. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about app use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers. The information generated relating to our app is used to create reports about the use of the app. Google will store this information. Google’s privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.\n\nMost applications allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some applications allow you to reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many apps, including this one.\n\n(3) Using your personal information:\n\nPersonal information submitted to us via this app will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the app.\n\nWe may use your personal information to:\n\nadminister the app;\n\n(b) improve your browsing experience by personalising the app;\n\n(c) enable your use of the services available on the app;\n\n(d) send you non-marketing commercial communications;\n\n(e) send you email notifications which you have specifically requested;\n\n(f) send to you marketing communications relating to our business or the businesses of carefully-selected third parties which we think may be of interest to you by post or, where you have specifically agreed to this, by email or similar technology (you can inform us at any time if you no longer require marketing communications);\n\n(g) provide third parties with statistical information about our users – but this information will not be used to identify any individual user; and\n\n(h) deal with enquiries and complaints made by or about you relating to the app.\n\nWhere you submit personal information for publication on our app, we will publish and otherwise use that information in accordance with the license you grant to us.\n\n\n(4) Disclosures:\n\nWe may disclose information about you to any of our employees, officers, agents, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes as set out in this privacy policy.\n\nIn addition, we may disclose your personal information:\n\nto the extent that we are required to do so by law;\n\n(b) in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings\n\n(c) in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk);\n\n(d) to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset that we are (or are contemplating) selling; and\n\n(e) to any person who we reasonably believe may apply to a court or other competent authority for disclosure of that personal information where, in our reasonable opinion, such court or authority would be reasonably likely to order disclosure of that personal information.\n\nExcept as provided in this privacy policy, we will not provide your information to third parties.\n\n\n(5) International data transfers:\n\nInformation that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.\n\nInformation which you provide may be transferred to countries which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area.\n\nIn addition, personal information that you submit for publication on the app will be published on the internet and may be available, via the internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use or misuse of such information by others.\n\nYou expressly agree to such transfers of personal information.\n\n\n(6) Security of your personal information:\n\nWe will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.\n\nWe will store all the personal information you provide on our hosting provider’s secure (password and firewall protected) servers.\nOf course, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.\n\nYou are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential.

In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to our use of your personal information for marketing purposes, or we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of the use of your personal information for marketing purposes.\n\n\n(9) Third party apps:\n\nThe app contains links to other apps.
