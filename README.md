# octo
My first failed startup. 

Launched under the name 'globe' in 2015, Octo was an eReading app written in Swift for iOS. 

Globe offered free access to a world of fiction and non-fiction books by leveraging the power of native digital advertising.  The app went live for 13 months before being shut down.

The idea was to offer people everywhere access to great stories and allow people to read what they want, not what they can afford.

I'm still very interested in the intersection of publishing and technology so if you're a developer looking into the same thing get in touch.
